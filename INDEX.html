            <p class="SectionSubTag">Computer Science, the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design. Computer science also makes heavy use of hypothesis testing and experimentation during the conceptualization, design, measurement, and refinement of new algorithms, information structures, and computer architectures.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2021, many latest technologies will emerge, particularly in the fields of computer science and engineering. These latest technologies are only going to get better in 2021, and they may even make it into the hands of the average individual.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are many technology in computer science. Some of them are given below:-</p>

            <p class="SectionTag"><strong><h1>Artificial intelligence:-</h1></strong></p>
            <p class="SectionSubTag">Machine code that mimics human and animal intelligence is at the heart of artificial intelligence (AI). Professionals in artificial intelligence (AI) create algorithms and programme machines to do human-like activities. Artificial intelligence (AI) is already widely used to detect credit card fraud, identify disease outbreaks, and improve satellite navigation.The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.The attendees became the founders and leaders of AI research.They and their students produced programs that the press described as "astonishing":computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defenseand laboratories had been established around the world.

                Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[30] Herbert Simon predicted, "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do". Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, "within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved".</p>

            <p class="SectionSubTag">Robotics is a field that studies and develops robots in order to make life easier. Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that includes computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other computer science technologies are used in robotics.

                In industries such as manufacturing, farming, and food preparation, robots attempt to improve safety and efficiency. Robotics are used to build cars, do dangerous activities such as bomb dispersal, and perform intricate procedures.</p>

            <p class="SectionTag"><strong><h1>Cybersecurity:-</h1></strong></p>
            <p class="SectionSubTag">Cybersecurity is concerned with preventing cyberthreats and attacks on computer systems and networks. As businesses continue to store data in the cloud and conduct business online, the need for better protection grows.

                Cyberattacks cause enormous financial losses to individuals, corporations, and governments. The Colonial Pipeline, for example, lost $5 million in May 2021 due to a ransomware attack in the eastern United States, which resulted in higher gas costs for consumers.
                
                Cybersecurity experts work for consulting firms, computer firms, and businesses and financial institutions. Apple, Lockheed Martin, and Capital One are among the major employers. A bachelor’s degree is required for the finest cybersecurity employment; however, some firms prefer a master’s degree.</p>

            <p class="SectionTag"><strong><h1>Data Science:-</h1></strong></p>
            <p class="SectionSubTag"><left>Data science was the next big thing throughout much of the first decade of the twenty-first century. Data science has existed for far longer than the last two decades. Data analysis has been a necessary duty for businesses, governments, institutions, and departments for millennia. Data analysis is useful for determining the effectiveness of operations, conducting employee surveys, and gauging people’s general mood.

                Data analysis is one of the earliest tasks for which computers are used. Data analysis was so popular in the early 2000s that students were taught introductory classes on the subject in school.
                
                The advantage of a career in data science is that you are an integral component of the company’s overall operation, regardless of the domain in which it operates. Any organisation you serve is likely to rely on the data you generate and the interpretations you provide as part of their business strategy.
                
                Data science is commonly utilised in retail and e-commerce to determine the success of campaigns and the general trend of product growth. This, in turn, aids in the development of marketing strategies for specific items or types of products. In health care, data informatics can help clinicians choose the safest and most effective treatments for patients by recommending low-cost options and packages.</left></p>
